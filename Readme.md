# Refactoring

Starting point to illustrate several refactorings.

## Conditionals

### Decompose
Extract methods from the condition, then and else part.

### Consolidate 
Combine conditions with the same result.

### Guard Clauses
Conditinal behaviour can make the path unclear.

### Strategy
Use a strategy to decide the outcome.

### Replace with Polymorphism
Different behaviour based on an identifier (int, enum, type). Encapsulate in class.
